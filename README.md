The dataset we will be working with contains information on various cars. For each car we have information about the technical aspects of the vehicle such as the motor's displacement, the weight of the car, the miles per gallon, and how fast the car accelerates. Using this information we will predict the origin of the vehicle, either North America, Europe, or Asia. We can see, that unlike our previous classification datasets, we have three categories to choose from, making our task slightly more challenging.

* The dataset is hosted by the University of California Irvine on their [machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG).
